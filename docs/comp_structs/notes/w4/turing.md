## Church's Thesis

Churchâ€™s Thesis states that: **Every discrete function computable by *any realisable machine* is computable by a Turing Machine**.

In other words, A turing machine can be made to replace any machine that already exists in general.

A function is computable if an algo can be made to do the job of the function.

## The halting problem

## The Universal Function

$f_U (K,j) = T_K(j)$

This means that a Turing Machine that runs $U$ is a Turing machine that is capable of simulating an arbitrary Turing machine (with spec. $K$) on arbitrary input ($j$). This is called a Universal Turing Machine.
